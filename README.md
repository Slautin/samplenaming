# Sample naming for CAMM_MSERC at University of Tennessee, Knoxville

A Python code package for sample naming and tracking.
Every entry has a unique entry id, which is generated by code. The id is increased by the time of the entry being created.
Every sample can have multiple entries and how the sample be synthesized should be recorded in the first entry (FirstEntryID).
The history of a sample or an entry is automatically recorded in "History". 


## Installation

Install samplenaming with python. 
Step 1: clone the code to your local computer, and then run "python setup.py install" in the samplenaming folder.
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:TaoLiang120/samplenaming.git
  cd samplenaming
  python setup.py install
```
Step 2: edit and copy samplenaming.yaml to your root directory. You can use any text editor to change samplenaming.yaml. Below,  I use "vi" command in OS or Linux systems as an example.
```bash
  vi samplenaming.yaml 
  cp samplenaming.yaml ~
```
If you encounter any problem with unknown modules, just run "pip install modulename".

## Usage/Examples

I have put several Python codes in the "examples" folder to show how to use it. The main code is located at samplenaming/core/snsummary.py. For those who are familar with Python, you can read the source code for additional functions/methods of the SNSummary object.

The firsttime.py is to generate the folder and files. Only run once after installation.

The add_an_entry.py is to add an entry to database. 
```bash
from samplenaming.core.snsummary import SNSummary

thissummary = SNSummary()

## add an entry without uploading files
from samplenaming.core.snsummary import SNSummary

thissummary = SNSummary()
SNSummary.display_entries(thissummary.df, display_style="compact")

## add an entry with uploading files
upload_files = ["upload1.txt", "upload2.in"]
thissummary.add_an_entry(upload_files=upload_files)
SNSummary.display_entries(thissummary.df, display_style="compact")


## add an entry based on a previous entry in database (from entry ID)
upload_files = None
thisid = 1002
thissummary.add_an_entry_from_id(thisid, upload_files=upload_files)
SNSummary.display_entries(thissummary.df, display_style="Full")
```
In addition to add_an_entry_from_id, you add an entry based on previous qrstring (string for QRcode) in database by add_an_entry_from_qrcode(qrstring, upload_files=None).



The query.py is to screen entries and save the results
```bash
from samplenaming.core.snsummary import SNSummary

print("========== Original Entries ============")
thissummary = SNSummary()
SNSummary.display_entries(thissummary.df, display_style="compact")

print("========== After first screening ============")
ids = thissummary.query_by_key_value_in("History", 1001, reset_df=False)
thissummary.query_display(display_style="Query")

print("========== Contineous screening ============")
ids = thissummary.query_by("Characterization", ["XRD", "SEM"], reset_df=False)
thissummary.query_display(display_style="Query")

print("========== reset screening ============")
elements = ["H", "O"]
style = "INCLUDE" #option: "EXCLUDE", "EXACT"
ids = thissummary.query_by_elements(elements, style=style, reset_df=True)

print("========== save to file ============")
filename = "SNquery_results.csv"
thissummary.query_save(filename=filename)
```

The reset_df in functions above is used to turn on/off continueous screening. If False, continueous screening, else reset to dataframe to original dataframe. List below are available querying functions in SNSummary:
1. query_by_key_value_in(key, value, reset_df=False), key: keyword in SNSummary, value: value string is part of key value of database
2. query_by(key, values, reset_df=False), key: keyword in SNSummary, values: list of values
3. query_by_elements(elements, style="Include", reset_df=True), elements: list of elements, style: "Include", "Exclude" or "Exact"
4. query_by_ncompons(ncompons, reset_df=False); ncompons: list of number of elements, eg. [3, 4, 5]
5. query_by_qrstring(value), value: qrstring
6. query_by_ids(eids), where eids are a list of entry IDs
All of functions return a list of entry ids.
